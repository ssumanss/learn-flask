# Linear Algebra

# Welcome to Abstract Algebra Course

This webpage is dedicated to the course of ==Abstract Algebra== taught in sememster I for the degree of MA/MSc in Mathematics in TMBU, Bhagalpur.

## Prequesite

This course presumes the introductry knowledge of groups, rings and fields. Some knowledge of vector space is always helpful.

## Syllabus

- Group action and Sylow theorem
- Series of subgroups
- Integral Domains
- Extension Fieds
- Modules
- Insolvability of equation

## Objectives

- Application of Group Action
  + Use it to prove sylow theorems
- Application of Sylow Theorem to study small groups
- PID and ED
- Understand different kinds of field extension
- Studying Modules
- To know that why equation of degree can't have a formula for roots

## Linear Transformation

In this course we will learn about linear transformation.



The solution of quadratic equation $ax^2+ bx + c$ is given by 

$$
x_{1,2} = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

    * [X] item A
    * [ ] item B

        + [x] item a
        + [ ] item b
        + [x] item c
    * [X] item C
- [ ] item 2
- [ ] item 3

When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
