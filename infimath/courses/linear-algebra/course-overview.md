# Linear Algebra

# Welcome to Abstract Algebra Course

This webpage is dedicated to the course of {==Abstract Algebra==} taught in sememster I for the degree of MA/MSc in Mathematics in TMBU, Bhagalpur.

## Prequesite

This course presumes the introductry knowledge of groups, rings and fields. Some knowledge of vector space is always helpful.

## Syllabus

- Group action and Sylow theorem
- Series of subgroups
- Integral Domains
- Extension Fieds
- Modules
- Insolvability of equation

## Objectives

- Application of Group Action
  + Use it to prove sylow theorems
- Application of Sylow Theorem to study small groups
- PID and ED
- Understand different kinds of field extension
- Studying Modules
- To know that why equation of degree can't have a formula for roots

## Linear Transformation

In this course we will learn about linear transformation.

The solution of quadratic equation $ax^2+ bx + c$ is given by

$$
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$
